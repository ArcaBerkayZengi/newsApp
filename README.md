An animated Launch Screen appears at the launch of the application. After that, I used Alamofire to fetch the data from "newsapi.org".

I used Redacted for Loading View. I used Kingfisher library for images.

I have put two Tab Items below as "News" and "Favorites".

If you press the news in the News section, the details of the news will appear.

In this detail section, there are buttons to add to favorites, share the news and view the news source.

I used WebView to view the news feed. I used UIActivityViewController to share the news.

I used Core Data to keep the news in Favorites.

If your internet goes out during the application, you will automatically encounter an error. I used NetworkManager to do this.

I have also included in-app images below for better explanation.
